GASPAR NOÉ. AN OVERVIEW OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL MOVIE DIRECTOR OF THE 2000s is a publication that collects interviews and critical articles on the filmography of the famous Argentinean director.  
The images in the book are frames from all of Noé's movies, edited with Processing to enhance certain aspects through glitching, datamoshing and pixel sorting.  
In I STAND ALONE and IRREVERSIBLE the aspect of distortion of reality is accentuated, in ENTER THE VOID there is the exasperation of the stylistic choices of the director in the representation of the use of drugs, in LOVE the explicit is emphasised and in CLIMAX the glitch recalls the citations of the 1980s/1990s.  
The chapter openings are made with Touchdesigner, starting from other movie frames.
